Hello, my name is Petar Shomov and this is my blog. I am a software developer with about 20 years in the industry. I think I am doing and learning about interesting things so I thought I would share them and probably do them even better because of that. I am interested most recently in design of all things digital but I like architecty things as well as programmy things. I work mostly in OSX and Linux but I have spent way too much time in Windows too.
