I am trying to get my first visual iteration of the blog and it is taking longer then I expect (which in itself was expected, sigh ...) so I thought while I am working on that I should first briefly note the visual elements, the concepts if you will, that I have included here and the ones I have not. My understanding of design is a big part of it is about making choices of what you offer and also what you _do not_ offer, both parts on par in their importance.

For the accidental visitors of my blog I would like them to first and foremost notice the content and then may be if they are interested make it easy get a feeling for who the auther is (that would be me).

**Content** is a list of posts, each of which has a title, content and date of creation. That has to be the minimum with the obvious omission of comments. I mean I could have skipped date but I do find myself looking at the date of other people's posts so why shouldn't I do the same, right?
<br>Comments are not here mostly due to not having a particularly clear idea how to add them to my statically hosted blog. I have a feeling they are coming soon though.

**Author** is the section where the visitor can get some _feeling_ about the person writing those words.
A picture and a name should be a good start. The name itself is a link to the very first post in this blog where I indulged myself in a bit more of an introduction of my character. Thought that level of intimacy should require the trouble of clicking a link ;)
<br>GitHub and Twitter links to my accounts would reveal a bit more about me should the visitor feel compelled to find out more about yours truely.

I am pretty happy about my selection of elements, still it is definitely subject to change.

Next time - the _invisible_ and all the things I did not add ...
