So I am all fired up about not sucking so much designing web and mobile apps and I though I really need some exercise. I recently read this great book - [Design for Hackers: Reverse Engineering Beauty](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956) and I thought - why not start a blog in the rowest form possible and little by little try to make it better. Looking forward to iteration one ;)
