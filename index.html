I think it is awesome. But before I get to that I would like to give you a quick outline how I got here.</p><p>My <a href="/common-problems-with-mvvm-apps-take-two/">last post</a> I was telling you about the friction I experienced trying to build a Xamarin Forms MVVM - all kinds of logic in view models, hard to have overview, hard to test, hard to understand. I considered <a href="http://reactiveui.net">ReactiveUI</a> since I found it really really promising. I also found it to be too much of an all-in kind of proposition and the lack of documentation to even get started really killed it for me. Turned to JavaScript community in search of good ideas, considered Flux and almost started on a Flux-inspired port in .NET.</p><p>And then I bumped into <a href="http://redux.js.org">Redux</a> and I <em>loved</em> everything about it - simple, powerful, versatile. It&#39;s like I head a blurry image of what I wanted and Redux just put everything in focus. I immediately knew it was exactly what I was looking for.</p><p>So I rushed out and made a port to .NET which I call <a href="http://github.com/pshomov/reducto">Reducto</a>.</p><p>Let me try to explain the basic concepts in Reducto:</p><ul><li><strong>Action</strong> - an object which describes what has happened - LoggingIn, SignedOut, etc. The object contains all the information relevant to the action - username, password, status, etc. Usually there are many actions in an app</li><li><strong>Reducer</strong> - a side-effect free function that receives the current state of your app and an action. If the reducer does not know how to handle the action it should return the state as is. If the reducer can handle the action it makes a copy of the state, it modifies it in response to the action and returns the copy.</li><li><strong>Store</strong> - it is an object that contains your whole app&#39;s state. It also has a reducer. We <em>dispatch</em> an action to the store which hands it to the reducer together with the current app state and then uses the return value of the reducer as the new state of the app. There is only one store in your app. It&#39;s created when your app starts and gets destroyed when your app quits. Your MVVM view models can <em>subscribe</em> to be notified when the state changes so they can update themselves accordingly.</li></ul><p>Having a single reducer operate on the whole state of the app probably sounds a bit scary but the trick is to <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter/Magic/Reducto#Overview"><em>compose</em> the reducer from many smaller, simpler reducers</a> which distribute the responsibility of updating different parts of the state. More on that in my next post.</p><p>The basic idea is to create a store and give it a reducer(a composite one quite likely). We dispatch actions to the store which, with the help of reducers, updates the state. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>Besides these core concepts in Reducto(and Redux) there are a couple more that are quite useful:</p><ul><li><strong>Async action</strong> - a function that may have side effects. This is where you talk to your database, call a web service, navigate to a view model, etc. Async actions can also dispatch actions (as described in the core concepts).</li><li><strong>Middleware</strong> - these are functions that can be hooked in the Store dispatch mechanism so you can do things like logging, profiling, authorization, etc. It&#39;s sort of a plugin mechanism which can be quite useful.</li></ul><p>Let&#39;s jump right in and see an example. Let&#39;s look at a very simple model of the app state which is only concerned with logging a user in. To make things simple I have presented this in the form of a unit test with the assertions showing what the expectations are</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/d3cd0ffa326dc042cf31.js"></script><p>The example starts off with defining the app state - LoginState. Point of interest here is that it is a <code>struct</code>. Remember that app state is passed to the reducer which is supposed to return a copy of it. <code>Struct</code>s have the benefit of being passed by value by default so they get copied naturally whenever they are passed as an argument.</p><p>Defined are two actions - LoginStarted and LoginSucceeded. They contain interesting information submitted from the user in the case of the former action and the authenticating service for the latter one.<br>On Line 31 we define a reducer for the app state and then we define how we handle both actions. On a side note, if an action is dispatched that is not handled by the reducer, he sends the app state unmodified back.</p><p>Line 45 defines the app store and let the store have its reducer.<br>Line 47 we see a subscription to the store, which gets notified whenever there is an update to the state. In line 70 we remove the subscription.</p><p>So here are the benefits that I see</p><ul><li>the logic is isolated in those reducers</li><li>defining the reducers is very simple and does not require creating classes, inheriting or anything like that. A function is enough.</li><li>testing is extremely simple - dispatch some actions, assert on the state</li><li>framework agnostic - MVVM, MVC, WebForms apps can use it, but also this seems like an all around good way to structure all kinds of apps really.</li></ul><p>A few interesting statistics regarding Reducto</p><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>lines of code</td><td>~260</td></tr><tr><td>dependencies</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>packaging</td><td><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Reducto/">NuGet PCL</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In my next post I will dive a bit deeper in Reducto - Async actions and Composite reducers and connecting all of this in a Xamarin Forms app. The code for that post is already in development <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/reducto.sample">over here</a>.</p><p>And please, do share your thoughts in the comments ;)</p></article><article class="index"><h2><a href="common-problems-with-mvvm-apps-take-two" tabindex>Common problems with MVVM apps - take two</a></h2><h5>2015-09-28</h5><p></p><p>My last post <a href="/common-problems-with-mvvm-apps/">Common problems with MVVM</a> was it seems pretty vague and needs a concrete example to make a bit more sense. Not to mention in an attempt to not sound too authoritative I managed to represent myself like someone who is just starting with MVVM and and is taking too big of a bite.</p><p>Let&#39;s dive right into a typical example of a login page view model from a Xamarin Forms app:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/eb03fc62e07b9497d12a.js"></script><p>In case you are wondering - I am using <a href="https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged">Fody.PropertyChanged</a> to skip the minutiae of property change notifications.</p><p>The problem in my opinion is in the Login command - lines 23-25. Upon triggering the Login command the view model invokes the authentication process and in the case of success, navigates to the &quot;main&quot; view.</p><ol><li>The view model should not know about the authentication process at all. Neither when nor how it should be accomplished. It&#39;s not important to the view and makes it harder to test it. Should we decide to handle failure to authenticate, the code in that login command will get more complicated real quick.</li><li>The view model should not know anything about the navigation process. Again neither when nor how. Not relevant to the view. It makes it more difficult to experiment with the view or use it in a different way - for example for Sign Up.</li></ol><p>I think we would be better off with a view model more like this one:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/b297f5e661f88689cca4.js"></script><p>Yes, I made up a pubsub &quot;thing&quot; that allows for publishing and subscribing ;-).</p><p>Generally speaking if view models are not the place for app logic, what kind of logic should be in there? I think we should have there animation logic, syncing states between controls in the view and in general logic directly connected to the view itself and its components.</p><p>Now this model is much simpler and rather easy to test. In fact it is so simple I think I just lost interest in testing it.</p><p>I would rather test the logic that controls it, and that is what I really wanted to get you curious about ;)</p><p>I will keep working on that new sample but meanwhile I encourage you to post your thoughts in the comments below.</p><p>Until next time.</p></article><article class="index"><h2><a href="common-problems-with-mvvm-apps" tabindex>Common problems with MVVM apps</a></h2><h5>2015-09-22</h5><p></p><p>Those few who have read my blog before might remember me raving about the combo <a href="/worry-free-mvvm-with-xamarin-forms/">Fody.PropertyChanged + MVVMCommand</a>. I was pretty excited to get some good comments on that post and it is really <a href="/worry-free-mvvm-with-xamarin-forms/#comments">the comments</a> that are the reason I am writing this post.</p><p>I have to say it right away - I am not very experienced writing MVVM apps. I am quite experienced developer (~20 years of experience) but I just haven&#39;t been around <strong>native desktop</strong> app development in the last 10 years. I did find myself involved recently however in Xamarin.Forms mobile apps and I must say MVVM is pretty nice. I should mention I have been doing a lot of web development in JavaScript both server and client side which should bring back a bit of credibility to my observations.</p><p><em>UPDATE:</em> I realized I seem to have underplayed myself so here is what I would rather say - I have read and watched a lot connected with MVVM and have about 1 year of on/off writing MVVM apps(Xamarin Forms). I also have been using or examining UI frameworks in JavaScript, Ruby, Python. Mostly JavaScript though.</p><p>So after being around <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> here are the things that I find wrong with most of the examples of MVVM apps I find on the web:</p><ul><li><p><strong>App logic is distributed and disconnected</strong></p><p>This is the main point really and the other two are a consequence of it - there is no central app object or a system which controls the flow and holds the state of the app.</p></li><li><p><strong>Too much logic and responsibilities in the <del>views</del>view models</strong></p><p>Since app logic has no special home it is spread over <del>views</del>view models. Those are fetching data from services and transforming it to their own structure, doing navigation to other views, etc. These extra responsibility only make changing the flow of the app and reusing the views more difficult. I am talking about view models like <a href="https://github.com/dotnetcurry/wpf-mvvmlight/blob/master/WPF_MVVMLight_CRUD/ViewModel/MainViewModel.cs">this</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Tutorials/blob/master/Sample%20-%20TwitterSearch/TwitterSearch.Core/ViewModels/TwitterViewModel.cs">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rid00z/FreshMvvm/blob/master/samples/FreshMvvmSampleApp/FreshMvvmSampleApp/PageModels/ContactPageModel.cs">this</a> one. In my opinion <del>views</del>view models should receive data, take care of the user interactions in the view and send out notifications/actions with the data the user has submitted. Here is a link to a blog post by Adam Kemp that goes in detail about <a href="http://blog.adamkemp.com/2015/03/decoupling-views.html">decoupled views</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Not good enough testing of the behaviour of the app due to issues described in the previous two points</strong></p><p>Testing of the app is limited to testing individual <del>views</del>view models, it is quite hard to test the flow of the app unless you are up for setting up a lot of infrastructure and usually plenty of mocking.</p></li></ul><p>MVVM frameworks that are on the market either (inadvertently) support these design shortcomings (dependency injection containers make it super easy to get all kinds of services in the view model with minimal effort) or at best do not address them at all. To be fair these frameworks are mostly trying to smooth out the MVVM pattern and are not trying too hard to advise you on app architecture but their samples are doing that in a way.</p><p>So back to those comments mentioned earlier.<br>I wrote I am going to write <strong>my</strong> idea of a good mobile app and I would like to show you what I have been up to. Coming up real soon ;)</p><p><em>UPDATE:</em> fixed broken links to the examples</p></article><article class="index"><h2><a href="comments-powered-by-github" tabindex>Comments powered by GitHub</a></h2><h5>2015-06-08</h5><p></p><p>Maybe it&#39;s a bit too early to start meta-posting but I am starting to doubt the decisions I took regarding this so may be if I go through the process of it I might feel a bit better.</p><p>This blog is hosted on GitHub pages. I am not entirely sure why GitHub has this service but it is very cool for us who use it. The deployment model is awesome (git push on a branch and you are done), it is free and hopefully with good CDN. That last part I will try to measure soon-ish. One important limitation - it is static pages only. Which calls for interesting combinations of static site generators and JavaScript.</p><p>GitHub does not provide any comment system as such, so the blogging story is somewhat incomplete. Which once again makes for a good challenge. Setting up a database and using it for comments is out of the question for me - have to host it somewhere, setting up all the processes around the management of comments - posting comments, reviewing, e-mail notifications, responding by e-mail, etc. It basically would erase the simplicity GitHub pages gives me.</p><p>There is <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, they host and take care of all those things but in return you pay with your visitors/readers privacy. At a glance it looks like the their JavaScript API is fine so using their services is feasable but probably would have lost some level of customization. All in all not a bad option just feeling uneasy since it is not quite clear what kind of deal am I getting.</p><p>At this point I get this idea that it would be really awesome if I can somehow get the GitHub issue discussion page and embed it into my blog. I checked out the GitHub issues API - looked good; I googled around and found this <a href="http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html">post by Ivan Zuzak</a> essentially implementing the same idea. I stole a whole lot of code from that post but I need a few more things to make it really work well.</p><p>So what are the pros and cons with the GitHub-issue-as-a-backend:</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Open API to access the comments, accessible by anyone, which is right - I do not own anyone&#39;s comments</li><li>GitHub handles sending email notifications as well as answering to comments by email</li><li>Full control over the HTML/CSS of the comments section</li><li>Trustworthy (so far) keeper of the data - GitHub</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>commenters do need a GitHub account</li></ul><p>I believe my current and potential readers are the kind of people who do have a GitHub account so hopefully this one drawback does not matter, but if you would like to comment and don&#39;t have an account please tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/pshomov">me</a> and I would proxy on your behalf.</p><p>I think I feel better now ;-)</p></article><article class="index"><h2><a href="worry-free-mvvm-with-xamarin-forms" tabindex>Worry-free MVVM with Xamarin Forms</a></h2><h5>2015-05-25</h5><p></p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> - Super-clean MVVM example with automatic Command status updates <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/mvvmeasy">here</a></p><hr><p>Xamarin Forms is great for writing decent looking applications on all three major mobile platforms - iOS, Android and Windows Mobile. The Xaml support and databindings are great help to keep things clean and simple.</p><p>So I am working on a Xamarin Forms project where we were in the process of choosing some framework or library to help us with implementing the MVVM pattern and more specifically the view models where it is necessary to send notifications as properties get changed. We looked at <a href="http://www.mvvmlight.net">MvvmLight</a> as well as a preview version of <a href="http://brianlagunas.com/first-look-at-the-prism-for-xamarin-forms-preview/">Prism</a>. Both of them provide a base class which has helper methods for implementing properties with sending notifications. Here is how a simple Login view model looks with Prism</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/e35832cbf51c82ac50c7.js"></script><p>A couple of things to notice here:</p><ul><li>Lot&#39;s of repetitive code in the property getters and setters</li><li>Extra complexity in both the property setters and the command itself due to keeping the enabled/disabled state of the Login command in sync (lines 22, 30, 63 and 72)</li><li>We need extra (and may I say not particularly pretty) testing of whether the property change notifications were sent and the update of the Login command status was triggered</li></ul><p>In order to clean things up let&#39;s use <a href="https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged#your-code">Fody.PropertyChanged</a> and get rid of Prism&#39;s BindableBase. If you have not looked at this MVVM specialized weaver, please take your time now to get introduced. I think you might like it. And here is how the new model looks like:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/eb3f85471e632bbcb9f6.js"></script><p>I think Fody.PropertyChanged is great, it helps us get rid of those super-boring, error-prone property getters and setters but unfortunately does nothing about updating the Login command state. In fact this version of the model does not work correctly since the Login command never gets enabled. One way to fix this problem is by making the Login command state be more MVVM-y. To do that let&#39;s use <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/mvvmeasy/blob/master/Infrastructure/MVVMCommand.cs">MVVMCommand</a> which is exactly like a normal Xamarin Forms Command except the second parameter has to be a lambda that returns the value of a property. Let&#39;s see how the fixed model looks:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/4b158ca0b0801809b0d6.js"></script><p>Notice how in line 28 the state of the command becomes extracted to a property - IsLoginEnabled. The reason that is good is because it plays on the strength of Fody.PropertyChanged. <strong>Meaning that Fody.PropertyChanged sends out ProprtyChanged notifications about IsLoginEnabled whenever one of the properties it&#39;s value is based on changes</strong>. Now all MVVMCommand needs to do is listen for those notifications and do the updating of the enabled/disabled command state. It&#39;s actually pretty simple:</p><script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/4e2b51ef94ca3c6cc508.js"></script><p>Testing this model now becomes really a rather simple and elegant exercise of changing properties and asserting on the value of other properties and no need to worry about bookkeeping regarding who update who.</p><p>Hope this makes sense, the source for a complete example is on <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/mvvmeasy">GitHub</a>.</p><p><del><strong>BTW</strong>: Sorry for not providing a way to do comments, now actively working on it, I promise. Meanwhile please <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/mvvmeasy/issues">create an issue on the example</a> and let&#39;s have the conversation over there ;)</del></p><p><strong>Update:</strong> As promised I have a way to post comments, but it&#39;s somewhat I-am-too-smart-for-my-own-good so I guess I will have to write a post about that ;)</p></article><article class="index"><h2><a href="elements-visible-invisible-and-missing-part-2" tabindex>Elements - visible, invisible and missing (part 2)</a></h2><h5>2014-05-31</h5><p></p><p>In my last post I was going over the elements of a blog that I use in my little experiment.

Basically if you go to a site like <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> and paste the url for the blog, the feed link will be descovered and used.
