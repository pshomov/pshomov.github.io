Not to mention in an attempt to not sound too authoritative I managed to represent myself like someone who is just starting with MVVM and and is taking too big of a bite.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s dive right into a typical example of a login page view model from a Xamarin Forms app:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/eb03fc62e07b9497d12a.js"></script>

<p>In case you are wondering - I am using <a href="https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged">Fody.PropertyChanged</a> to skip the minutiae of property change notifications. </p>
<p>The problem in my opinion is in the Login command - lines 23-25. Upon triggering the Login command the view model invokes the authentication process and in the case of success, navigates to the &quot;main&quot; view.</p>
<ol>
<li>The view model should not know about the authentication process at all. Neither when nor how it should be accomplished. It&#39;s not important to the view and makes it harder to test it. Should we decide to handle failure to authenticate, the code in that login command will get more complicated real quick.  </li>
<li>The view model should not know anything about the navigation process. Again neither when nor how. Not relevant to the view. It makes it more difficult to experiment with the view or use it in a different way - for example for Sign Up.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we would be better off with a view model more like this one:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/b297f5e661f88689cca4.js"></script>

<p>Yes, I made up a pubsub &quot;thing&quot; that allows for publishing and subscribing ;-).</p>
<p>Generally speaking if view models are not the place for app logic, what kind of logic should be in there? I think we should have there animation logic, syncing states between controls in the view and in general logic directly connected to the view itself and its components.</p>
<p>Now this model is much simpler and rather easy to test. In fact it is so simple I think I just lost interest in testing it.</p>
<p>I would rather test the logic that controls it, and that is what I really wanted to get you curious about ;)</p>
<p>I will keep working on that new sample but meanwhile I encourage you to post your thoughts in the comments below.</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>

I was pretty excited to get some good comments on that post and it is really <a href="/worry-free-mvvm-with-xamarin-forms/#comments">the comments</a> that are the reason I am writing this post.</p>
<p>I have to say it right away - I am not very experienced writing MVVM apps. I am quite experienced developer (~20 years of experience) but I just haven&#39;t been around <strong>native desktop</strong> app development in the last 10 years. I did find myself involved recently however in Xamarin.Forms mobile apps and I must say MVVM is pretty nice. I should mention I have been doing a lot of web development in JavaScript both server and client side which should bring back a bit of credibility to my observations.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em> I realized I seem to have underplayed myself so here is what I would rather say - I have read and watched a lot connected with MVVM and have about 1 year of on/off writing MVVM apps(Xamarin Forms). I also have been using or examining UI frameworks in JavaScript, Ruby, Python. Mostly JavaScript though.</p>
<p>So after being around <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> here are the things that I find wrong with most of the examples of MVVM apps I find on the web:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>App logic is distributed and disconnected</strong></p>
<p>This is the main point really and the other two are a consequence of it - there is no central app object or a system which controls the flow and holds the state of the app.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Too much logic and responsibilities in the <del>views</del>view models</strong></p>
<p>  Since app logic has no special home it is spread over <del>views</del>view models. Those are fetching data from services and transforming it to their own structure, doing navigation to other views, etc. These extra responsibility only make changing the flow of the app and reusing the views more difficult. I am talking about view models like <a href="https://github.com/dotnetcurry/wpf-mvvmlight/blob/master/WPF_MVVMLight_CRUD/ViewModel/MainViewModel.cs">this</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MvvmCross/MvvmCross-Tutorials/blob/master/Sample%20-%20TwitterSearch/TwitterSearch.Core/ViewModels/TwitterViewModel.cs">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rid00z/FreshMvvm/blob/master/samples/FreshMvvmSampleApp/FreshMvvmSampleApp/PageModels/ContactPageModel.cs">this</a> one. In my opinion <del>views</del>view models should receive data, take care of the user interactions in the view and send out notifications/actions with the data the user has submitted. Here is a link to a blog post by Adam Kemp that goes in detail about <a href="http://blog.adamkemp.com/2015/03/decoupling-views.html">decoupled views</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Not good enough testing of the behaviour of the app due to issues described in the previous two points</strong></p>
<p>Testing of the app is limited to testing individual <del>views</del>view models, it is quite hard to test the flow of the app unless you are up for setting up a lot of infrastructure and usually plenty of mocking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>MVVM frameworks that are on the market either (inadvertently) support these design shortcomings (dependency injection containers make it super easy to get all kinds of services in the view model with minimal effort) or at best do not address them at all. To be fair these frameworks are mostly trying to smooth out the MVVM pattern and are not trying too hard to advise you on app architecture but their samples are doing that in a way.</p>
<p>So back to those comments mentioned earlier.<br/> 
I wrote I am going to write <strong>my</strong> idea of a good mobile app and I would like to show you what I have been up to. Coming up real soon ;)</p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em> fixed broken links to the examples</p>

<p>This blog is hosted on GitHub pages. I am not entirely sure why GitHub has this service but it is very cool for us who use it. The deployment model is awesome (git push on a branch and you are done), it is free and hopefully with good CDN. That last part I will try to measure soon-ish. One important limitation - it is static pages only. Which calls for interesting combinations of static site generators and JavaScript.</p>
<p>GitHub does not provide any comment system as such, so the blogging story is somewhat incomplete. Which once again makes for a good challenge. Setting up a database and using it for comments is out of the question for me - have to host it somewhere, setting up all the processes around the management of comments - posting comments, reviewing, e-mail notifications, responding by e-mail, etc. It basically would erase the simplicity GitHub pages gives me.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, they host and take care of all those things but in return you pay with your visitors/readers privacy. At a glance it looks like the their JavaScript API is fine so using their services is feasable but probably would have lost some level of customization. All in all not a bad option just feeling uneasy since it is not quite clear what kind of deal am I getting. </p>
<p>At this point I get this idea that it would be really awesome if I can somehow get the GitHub issue discussion page and embed it into my blog. I checked out the GitHub issues API - looked good; I googled around and found this <a href="http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/02/18/github-hosted-comments-for-github-hosted-blogs.html">post by Ivan Zuzak</a> essentially implementing the same idea. I stole a whole lot of code from that post but I need a few more things to make it really work well.</p>
<p>So what are the pros and cons with the GitHub-issue-as-a-backend:</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open API to access the comments, accessible by anyone, which is right - I do not own anyone&#39;s comments</li>
<li>GitHub handles sending email notifications as well as answering to comments by email</li>
<li>Full control over the HTML/CSS of the comments section</li>
<li>Trustworthy (so far) keeper of the data - GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>commenters do need a GitHub account</li>
</ul>
<p>  I believe my current and potential readers are the kind of people who do have a GitHub account so hopefully this one drawback does not matter, but if you would like to comment and don&#39;t have an account please tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/pshomov">me</a> and I would proxy on your behalf.</p>
<p>  I think I feel better now ;-)</p>

<hr>
<p>Xamarin Forms is great for writing decent looking applications on all three major mobile platforms - iOS, Android and Windows Mobile. The Xaml support and databindings are great help to keep things clean and simple. </p>
<p>So I am working on a Xamarin Forms project where we were in the process of choosing some framework or library to help us with implementing the MVVM pattern and more specifically the view models where it is necessary to send notifications as properties get changed. We looked at <a href="http://www.mvvmlight.net">MvvmLight</a> as well as a preview version of <a href="http://brianlagunas.com/first-look-at-the-prism-for-xamarin-forms-preview/">Prism</a>. Both of them provide a base class which has helper methods for implementing properties with sending notifications. Here is how a simple Login view model looks with Prism</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/e35832cbf51c82ac50c7.js"></script>

<p>A couple of things to notice here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lot&#39;s of repetitive code in the property getters and setters</li>
<li>Extra complexity in both the property setters and the command itself due to keeping the enabled/disabled state of the Login command in sync (lines 22, 30, 63 and 72)</li>
<li>We need extra (and may I say not particularly pretty) testing of whether the property change notifications were sent and the update of the Login command status was triggered</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to clean things up let&#39;s use <a href="https://github.com/Fody/PropertyChanged#your-code">Fody.PropertyChanged</a> and get rid of Prism&#39;s BindableBase. If you have not looked at this MVVM specialized weaver, please take your time now to get introduced. I think you might like it.
And here is how the new model looks like:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/eb3f85471e632bbcb9f6.js"></script>

<p>I think Fody.PropertyChanged is great, it helps us get rid of those super-boring, error-prone property getters and setters but unfortunately does nothing about updating the Login command state. In fact this version of the model does not work correctly since the Login command never gets enabled. One way to fix this problem is by making the Login command state be more MVVM-y. To do that let&#39;s use <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/mvvmeasy/blob/master/Infrastructure/MVVMCommand.cs">MVVMCommand</a> which is exactly like a normal Xamarin Forms Command except the second parameter has to be a lambda that returns the value of a property. Let&#39;s see how the fixed model looks:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/4b158ca0b0801809b0d6.js"></script>

<p>Notice how in line 28 the state of the command becomes extracted to a property - IsLoginEnabled. The reason that is good is because it plays on the strength of Fody.PropertyChanged. <strong>Meaning that Fody.PropertyChanged sends out ProprtyChanged notifications about IsLoginEnabled whenever one of the properties it&#39;s value is based on changes</strong>. Now all MVVMCommand needs to do is listen for those notifications and do the updating of the enabled/disabled command state. It&#39;s actually pretty simple:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/pshomov/4e2b51ef94ca3c6cc508.js"></script>

<p>Testing this model now becomes really a rather simple and elegant exercise of changing properties and asserting on the value of other properties and no need to worry about bookkeeping regarding who update who.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense, the source for a complete example is on <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/mvvmeasy">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><del><strong>BTW</strong>: Sorry for not providing a way to do comments, now actively working on it, I promise. Meanwhile please <a href="https://github.com/pshomov/mvvmeasy/issues">create an issue on the example</a> and let&#39;s have the conversation over there ;)</del></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> As promised I have a way to post comments, but it&#39;s somewhat I-am-too-smart-for-my-own-good so I guess I will have to write a post about that ;) </p>

Now, for the rest ...</p>
<p>What I have <em>not added</em> is links to similar posts, my twitter stream, blog rolls, archive, like button, retweet button, G+ button and all kinds of other buttons that are mostly create noise, do not look esthetically pleasing and seldomly used. Other omissions include footer, site map, copyright notices and all kinds of what I consider cruft.</p>
<p>Finally for the <em>invisible</em> - I have what seems to be an Atom feed for the web site and that one is machine discoverable but I decided to not make an official link to it on the site. Basically if you go to a site like <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> and paste the url for the blog, the feed link will be descovered and used. And that I think is enough visibility for that element. I think I will also try to surface that feed in the Google result if that is possible.</p>

My understanding of design is a big part of it is about making choices of what you offer and also what you <em>do not</em> offer, both parts on par in their importance.</p>
<p>For the accidental visitors of my blog I would like them to first and foremost notice the content and then may be if they are interested make it easy get a feeling for who the auther is (that would be me).</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong> is a list of posts, each of which has a title, content and date of creation. That has to be the minimum with the obvious omission of comments. I mean I could have skipped date but I do find myself looking at the date of other people&#39;s posts so why shouldn&#39;t I do the same, right?
<br>Comments are not here mostly due to not having a particularly clear idea how to add them to my statically hosted blog. I have a feeling they are coming soon though.</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong> is the section where the visitor can get some <em>feeling</em> about the person writing those words.
A picture and a name should be a good start. The name itself is a link to the very first post in this blog where I indulged myself in a bit more of an introduction of my character. Thought that level of intimacy should require the trouble of clicking a link ;)
<br>GitHub and Twitter links to my accounts would reveal a bit more about me should the visitor feel compelled to find out more about yours truely.</p>
<p>I am pretty happy about my selection of elements, still it is definitely subject to change.</p>
<p>Next time - the <em>invisible</em> and all the things I did not add ...</p>
