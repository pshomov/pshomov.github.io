    <content type="html"><p>In my last post I was going over the elements of a blog that I use in my little experiment. Now, for the rest ...</p>
<p>What I have <em>not added</em> is links to similar posts, my twitter stream, blog rolls, archive, like button, retweet button, G+ button and all kinds of other buttons that are mostly create noise, do not look esthetically pleasing and seldomly used. Other omissions include footer, site map, copyright notices and all kinds of what I consider cruft.</p>
<p>Finally for the <em>invisible</em> - I have what seems to be an Atom feed for the web site and that one is machine discoverable but I decided to not make an official link to it on the site. Basically if you go to a site like <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> and paste the url for the blog, the feed link will be descovered and used. And that I think is enough visibility for that element. I think I will also try to surface that feed in the Google result if that is possible.</p>

    <content type="html"><p>I am trying to get my first visual iteration of the blog and it is taking longer then I expect (which in itself was expected, sigh ...) so I thought while I am working on that I should first briefly note the visual elements, the concepts if you will, that I have included here and the ones I have not. My understanding of design is a big part of it is about making choices of what you offer and also what you <em>do not</em> offer, both parts on par in their importance.</p>
<p>For the accidental visitors of my blog I would like them to first and foremost notice the content and then may be if they are interested make it easy get a feeling for who the auther is (that would be me).</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong> is a list of posts, each of which has a title, content and date of creation. That has to be the minimum with the obvious omission of comments. I mean I could have skipped date but I do find myself looking at the date of other people&#39;s posts so why shouldn&#39;t I do the same, right?
<br>Comments are not here mostly due to not having a particularly clear idea how to add them to my statically hosted blog. I have a feeling they are coming soon though.</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong> is the section where the visitor can get some <em>feeling</em> about the person writing those words.
A picture and a name should be a good start. The name itself is a link to the very first post in this blog where I indulged myself in a bit more of an introduction of my character. Thought that level of intimacy should require the trouble of clicking a link ;)
<br>GitHub and Twitter links to my accounts would reveal a bit more about me should the visitor feel compelled to find out more about yours truely.</p>
<p>I am pretty happy about my selection of elements, still it is definitely subject to change.</p>
<p>Next time - the <em>invisible</em> and all the things I did not add ...</p>

    <content type="html"><p>So I am all fired up about not sucking so much designing web and mobile apps and I though I really need some exercise. I recently read this great book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956">Design for Hackers: Reverse Engineering Beauty</a> and I thought - why not start a blog in the rawest form possible and little by little try to make it better. Looking forward to iteration one ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><p>Hello, my name is Petar Shomov and this is my blog. I am a software developer with about 20 years in the industry. I think I am doing and learning about interesting things so I thought I should share them and probably do them even better because of that. I am interested most recently in design of all things digital but I like architect-y things as well as programm-y things. I work mostly in OSX and Linux but I have spent way too much time in Windows too.</p>
